    "To create a repo for a new project in the current working directory, call\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git init project-name\n",
    "        \n",
    "One thing you should <span style=\"color:red\">**not**</span> do is create one Git repo inside another. It becomes complicated very quickly since you need to specify to Git which of the the `.git` directories the update is stored in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I turn an existing project into a Git repo?<a name=\"two\"></a>\n",
    "Doing so is simple, just run\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git init\n",
    "        \n",
    "in the project's root directory, or\n",

    "- Cloning a repo creates a copy of an existing repo (including all of its history) in a new directory\n",
    "- To clone a repo, use command\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git clone URL\n",
    "      \n",
    "- `URL` define the repo you want to clone\n",
    "- You can also clone local repos with,\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git clone /existing/project\n",
    "        \n",
    "- If you want to call the clone something else, add the directory name you want,\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git clone /existing/project newprojectname\n",
    "        \n",
    "## How can I find out where a cloned repo originated?<a name=\"four\"></a>\n",
    "- When you clone a repo, Git remembers where the original repo was\n",
    "    - It does this by storing a **remote** in the new repo's configuration\n",
    "- If you use an onlin git repo hosting service like Github, a common task would be that you clone a repo from that site to work locally on your computer\n",
    "    - The copy on the website is the **remote**\n",
    "- If you are in a repo, you can list the names of its remotes using\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git remote\n",
    "        \n",
    "- You can use `git remote -v` to show the remote's URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I define remotes?<a name=\"five\"></a>\n",
    "- When you clone a repo, Git automatically creates a remote called `origin` that points to the original repo\n",
    "- More remotes can be added using\n",
    "        \n",
    "        $ git remote add remote-name URL\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Remove existing ones with,\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git remote rm remote-name\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I pull in changes from a remote repository?<a name=\"six\"></a>\n",
    "- Git keeps track of remote repos so that you can **pull** changes from those repos and **push** changes to them\n",
    "- Recall that a remote repo is often a repo in an online hosting service like Github\n",
    "- A typical workflow:\n",
    "    1. You **pull** in your collaborator's work from the remote repo (so you have the latest version)\n",
    "    2. Do some work yourself\n",
    "    3. Then **push** your work back to the remote so your collaborators have access to it\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `git pull remote branch` gets everything in `branch` in the remote repo identified as `remote` and merges it into the current branch of your local repo\n",
    "    - E.g. `git pull origin master`\n",
    "    \n",
    "## What happens if I try to pull when I have unsaved changes?<a name=\"seven\"></a>\n",
    "- Git stops you from pullin in changes from a remote repo when doing so might overwrite things you have done locally\n",
    "- The fix is simple. Do either:\n",
    "    1. Commit your local changes\n",
    "    2. Or revert them, then try to pull again\n",
    "    \n",
    "## How can I push my changes to a remote repo?<a name=\"eight\"></a>\n",
    "The most common way is,\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git push remote-name branch-name\n",
    "        \n",
    "which pushes the contents of your branch `branch-name` into a branch with the same name in the remote repo associated with `remote-name`\n",
    "\n",
    "## What happens if my push conflicts with someone else's work?<a name=\"nine\"></a>\n",
    "- Overwriting your work is bad, overwriting someone else's work is worse\n",
    "- To prevent this, Git does not allow you to push changes to a remote repo unless you have merged the contents of the remote repo into your own work\n"
