    "## What is version control?<a name=\"one\"></a>\n",
    "- **Version control system** â€” a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project\n",
    "    - Git is an example\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **About Git**:\n",
    "    - Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost\n",
    "    - Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work\n",
    "    - Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Where does Git store information? <a name=\"two\"></a>\n",
    "- Each of your Git projects has 2 parts:\n",
    "    1. the files and directories that you create and edit directly\n",
    "    2. the extra info that Git records about the project's history  \n",
    "    *The combination of these two is called a repository*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Git stores all of its extra info in a directory called `.git` located in the **root directory of the repository**\n",
    "    - Git expects this info to be laid out in a precise way\n",
    "    - Therefore, you should <span style=\"color:red\">**never**</span> edit or delete anything in `.git`\n",
    "    \n",
    "## How can I check the state of a repository <a name=\"three\"></a>\n",
    "Running the following displays a list of files that have been modified since the last time changes were saved,  \n",
    "\n",
    "       $ git status\n",
    "       \n",
    "## How can I tell what I have changed? <a name=\"four\"></a>\n",
    "- Git has a **staging** area in which it stores files with changes you want to save that haven't put saved yet \n",
    "- Putting files in the stagine area is like putting things in a box, while **committing** those changes is like putting that box in the mail\n",
    "    - You can add more things to the box or take things out as often as you want, but once you put it in the mail, you can't make further changes"

    "## What's the first step in saving changes? <a name=\"five\"></a>\n",
    "You commit changes to a Git repo in two steps:\n",
    "1. Add one or more files to the staging area\n",
    "    - `git add filename`\n",
    "    \n",

    "- `git diff -r HEAD` compares the state of your files with those in the staging area\n",
    "    - `-r` flag means \"*compare to a particular version*\"\n",
    "    - `HEAD` is a shortcut meaning \"*the most recent commit*\"\n",

    "- `git commit` saves the changes in the staging area\n",
    "    - It **always** saves everything in the staging area as one unit\n",
    "- Git requires you to write a **log message** when you commit changes\n",
    "    - By default, Git launches a text editor where you can write this message\n",
    "    - You can always keep things simple with `git commit -m \"some message in quotes\"`\n",
    "- If you accidentally mistype a commit message, you can change it with,\n",
    "    - `git commit --amend -m \"new message\"`\n",
    "    \n",
    "## How can I view a repo's history? <a name=\"eight\"></a>\n",
    "- `git log` is used to vies the **log** of the project's history\n",
    "    - Log entries are shown most recent first\n",
    "- The `commit` line displays a unique ID for the commit called a **hash**\n",
    "    - The other lines tell you who made the change. when, and what the log message says\n",
