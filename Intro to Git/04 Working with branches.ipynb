    "# Working with branches\n",

    "## What is a branch?<a name=\"one\"></a>\n",
    "- **Braches** allow you to have multiple versions of you work, and allows you to track each version systematically\n",
    "- Each branch is like a parallel universe\n",
    "    - Changes you make in one branch do not affect other branches (until you **merge** them back together)\n",
    "- Recall, Git uses a three-part structure to record a repo's history:\n",
    "    1. *blobs* for files\n",
    "    2. *trees* for the saved state of the repos\n",
    "    3. *commits* to record the changes\n",
    "- Branches are the reaspm Git need both trees and commits\n",
    "    - A commit will have two parents when branches are being merged\n",
    "    \n",
    "## How can I see what branches my repository has?<a name=\"two\"></a>\n",
    "- By default, every Git repo has a branch called `master`\n",
    "- To list all branches in a repo, run,\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git branch\n",
    "        \n",
    "*Note: The branch you are currenly in will have `*` next to it*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I view the difference between branches?<a name=\"three\"></a>\n",
    "`git diff branch-1..branch-2` shows the differences between two branches\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I switch from one branch to another?<a name=\"four\"></a>\n",
    "- `git checkout branch-name` can be used to switch between branches\n",
    "- Side note: `git rm file-name` removes a file and then stages the removal of that file with `git add`, all in one step\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I create a branch?<a name=\"five\"></a>\n",
    "- `git branch` can create a branch but the most common thing to do is create a branch then switch to that branch\n",
    "- To create a branch then switch to it in one step, use `git checkout -b branch-name`\n",
    "    - The contents of the new branch are initially identical to the contents of the original\n",
    "    - Once you start making changes, they only affect the new branch\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I merge two branches?<a name=\"six\"></a>\n",
    "- **Merging** is how you bring branches together\n",
    "    - When you merge one branch (call it **source**) into another (call it **destination**), Git incorporates the changes made to the source into the destination branch\n",
    "    - If the changes don't overlap, the result is a new commit in the destination branch that includes everything from the source\n",
    "- To merge two branches, you run\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git merge source destination\n",
    "        \n",
    "*Note: Git automatically opens an editory so you can write a log message.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are conflicts?<a name=\"seven\"></a>\n",
    "- Sometimes the changes in two branches will conflict with one another\n",
    "- In this case, Git relies on you to reconcile conflicting changes\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I merge two branches with conflicts?<a name=\"eight\"></a>\n",
    "- When there is a conflict during a merge, Git tells you there's a problem\n",
    "- Running `git status` after the merge reminds you which files have conflict that you need to resolve by printing `both modified:` beside the files' names\n",
    "- To resolve the conflict, edit the file to remove the markers and make whatever changes are needed to reconcile the conflict, then commit those changes"
