    "## How does Git store information? <a name=\"one\"></a>\n",
    "Git uses a three-level structure for this:\n",
    "1. A **commit** contains metadata such as author, commit message, and time of commit.\n",
    "2. Each commit has a **tree**, which tracks the names and locations in the repo when that commit happened.\n",
    "3. For each file listed in the tree, there is a **blob** which contains a compressed snapshot of the contents of the file when the commit happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fun fact: *blob* is short for *binary large object*, which is a SQL database term form \"may contain data of any kind\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "![Commit Tree Blob](imgs/commit_tree_blob2.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In the middle commit, `report.md` and `draft.md` were changed, so the blobs are shown next to that commit. `data/northern.csv` didn't change in that commit, so the tree links to the blob from the previous commit. Reusing blobs between commits help make common operations fast and minimizes storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a hash?<a name=\"two\"></a>\n",
    "- Every commit to a repo has a unique identfier called a **hash**\n",
    "    - The hash is normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string like `7c35a3ce607a14953f070f0f83b5d74c2296ef93`\n",
    "    - Most of the time, you only have to give Git the first 6 or 8 characters in order to identify a commit\n",
    "- Hashes enable Git to share data efficiently between repos\n",
    "- If two files are the same. their hashes are guaranteed to be the same\n",
    "    - Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have same ancestors, their hashes are the same\n",
    "    \n",
    "## How can I view a specific commit?<a name=\"three\"></a>\n",
    "- Use the command `git show` with the first few characters of the commit's hash\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Git's equivalent of a relative path?<a name=\"four\"></a>\n",
    "- A hash is like an absolute path; it identifies a specific commit\n",
    "- Another way to identify a commit is to use the equivalent of a relative path\n",
    "- `git show HEAD` always refers to the most recent commit\n",
    "- `git show HEAD~1` then refers to the commit before it\n",
    "- `git show HEAD~2` refers to the commit before that, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I see who changed what in a file?<a name=\"five\"></a>\n",
    "`git annotate file` shows who made the last change to each line of a file and when. Each line of the output contains five elements, with element 2 to 4 enclosed in parentheses:\n",
    "1. The first eight digits of the hash\n",
    "2. The author\n",
    "3. The time of the commit\n",
    "4. The line number\n",
    "5. The contents of the line\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I see what changed between two commits?<a name=\"six\"></a>\n",
    "- `git show` with a commit ID shows the changes made *in* a particular commit\n",
    "- To see changes *between* two commits, you can use `git show ID1..ID2`, where `ID1` and `ID2` identify the hashes of two commits\n",
    "- Something like `git show HEAD~1..HEAD~3` can be used to show the differences between the state of the repo one commit in the past and its state three commits in the past\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I add new files?<a name=\"seven\"></a>\n",
    "- Git doesn't track files by default\n",
    "- Instead, it waits until you have used `git add` at least once\n",
    "- Recall, `git status` will always tell you about files that are in your repo but aren't (yet) being tracked\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I tell Git to ignore certain files?<a name=\"eight\"></a>\n",
    "- Data analysis often produces temporary or immediate files that you don't want to save\n",
    "- You can tell it to stop paying attention to certain files by creating a file in the root directory of the repo called `.gitignore`\n",
    "    - In this file you can store a list of **wildcard** patterns (e.g. *.csv) or filenames to specify the files you want Git to ignore\n",
    "    \n",
    "## How can I remove unwanted files?<a name=\"nine\"></a>\n",
    "- `git clean -n` will show you a list of files that are in the repo, but whose history Git is not currently tracking\n",
    "- `git clean -f` will then delete those files\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Use this command carefully*. `git clean` only works on untracked files, so by definition, their history has not been saved. If you delete them with `git clean -f`, they're gone for good.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I see how Git is configured?<a name=\"ten\"></a>\n",
    "To see what the settings are, use `git config --list` with one of three additional options:\n",
    "1. `--system`: settings for every user on this computer\n",
    "2. `--global`: settings for every one of your projects\n",
    "3. `--local`: settings for one specific project\n",
    "\n",
    "Every level overrides the one above it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I change my Git configuration?<a name=\"eleven\"></a>\n",
    "Most of Git's setting should be left as is. However, there are two you should set on every computer you use: your name and email address. These are recorded in the log every time you commit a change.\n",
    "\n",
    "To change a configuration value for all of your projects on a particular computer user,\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git config --global setting value"
